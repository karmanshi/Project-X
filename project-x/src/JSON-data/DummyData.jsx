      "Lead is in materials all around us, often unseen. From factories, mines and spices to being in our water supply pipes, cosmetics and toys, lead infiltrates our daily lives, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Lead paint also remains common in many countries, disproportionately affecting the poor, who are more likely to be exposed to lead-contaminated environments.\n\nThis contamination takes its toll, with far-reaching health consequences for adults, such as cardiovascular disease, and impacts on children’s brain development, with knock-on effects on IQ, learning abilities, and future potential. The cost of this loss can be over 11 percent of lifetime income for children who will participate in the labor force.\n\nThe good news is that eliminating lead pollution is a solvable problem, but it requires partnerships, political commitment, and decisive action. We know it can be done, as the global community has successfully tackled similar challenges, such as removing lead from petrol and ozone-depleting substances like chlorofluorocarbons from refrigerants and aerosols. Now we just need to act—governments, multilaterals, private companies, and philanthropies working together.\n\nFortunately, momentum is building.  Recently, the United States Agency for International Development and UNICEF launched the Partnership for a Lead-Free Future, a global public-private partnership working to end childhood lead poisoning in low- and middle-income countries. The World Bank has joined this effort, alongside the World Health Organization, United Nations Environment Programme, Open Philanthropy, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Dangote Foundation, and many other member countries and partner organizations. \n\nWorking together we can significantly reduce the unnecessary lives lost due to cardiovascular disease as well as the gross domestic product loss caused by reductions in IQ and potential. Solutions exist—we don’t need to live with lead in our pipes, paints, or spices. But making this a reality requires investments and better and stronger regulations, along with behavioral changes so that people switch to cleaner alternatives.",

      "\n\nEmerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) face higher risks from climate change than advanced economies. If not addressed, these risks could threaten their stability, negatively impact economic opportunities and development outcomes, and even set back decades of work to end extreme poverty and boost prosperity in these countries.\n\nIn addition to these greater risks, EMDEs also face a significant gap in financing for climate investment opportunities. Just 14 percent of global climate finance flows reach EMDEs other than China, even though these countries represent about one-quarter of global gross domestic product. Adaptation is particularly underfunded— only 16% of domestic and international climate finance in developing economies (ex China) is channeled for adaptation. Out of this small share, 98% is either public resources or official financing.\n\nMoreover, while advanced economies and China can rely on domestic sources for over 90 percent of their climate finance, in other EMDEs less than half of climate finance is domestic in origin. Because banks dominate the financial sector landscape in EMDEs, with more than 80 percent of financial sector assets, they will inevitably have a large role to play in financing climate adaptation and mitigation efforts.\n\nYet at the moment EMDE banks provide far too little of that financing. According to a World Bank Group survey, climate financing is five percent or less of the lending portfolio for nearly 60 percent of EMDE banks—with 28 percent providing no climate financing at all.",
